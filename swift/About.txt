== Overview

These scripts build a package compatible with Swift/T, and provide
tests to check that the package works.

== Usage

. Change into this directory (+swift/+)
. Edit +Makefile+ to set the Tcl location
. Run +make+
. Run +./test-comd-tcl.sh+ .  This calls CoMD from Tcl once, producing a +stressXX+.
. Run +./test-comd-lib.swift+ .  This calls CoMD from Swift once, producing a +stressXX+.
